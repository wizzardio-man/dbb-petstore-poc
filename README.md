This is a simple POC for the /POST method testing approach for the pet store API.


## Used tools

- JS as a main programming language
- cucumber and jest as a test skeleton
- jest-cucumber library for running and as a main tool
- github actions
- axios for API requests


## Local usage

To run these tests make sure you did the following steps:

to install dependencies
```bash
  npm install
```

to run the tests
```bash
  npm run test
```
or
```bash
  npx jest
```

## Additional questions and clarifications

These are the things I've noticed during work and I need to clarify them as a QA engineer

1. The service has no authentication, so for now, it is impossible to test the authentication scenarios;

2. The ```id``` value can be applied in the POST call. I guess it is not correct since usually this value is generated by service. Having it here means also that user possibly can apply duplicates;

3. The service has no validators at all. It is possible to send an empty body, a body with incorrect parameters, wrong types, etc;

4. Also, I was able to use simple SQL injections in the fields. (But I guess the service is not using any DB under the hood so it's expected);

5. When I try to use XML body, I do not receive the same response as when I try to use JSON body (see the last test)
